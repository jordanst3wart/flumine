## Cricket Subscription

A cricket subscription can be added via the `sports_data_filter` on a strategy

```python 
strategy = ExampleStrategy(
    market_filter=streaming_market_filter(
        event_type_ids=["4"], market_types=["MATCH_ODDS"]
    ),
    sports_data_filter=["cricketSubscription"],
)
```

## Race Subscription

A race subscription can be added via the `sports_data_filter` on a strategy

```python 
strategy = ExampleStrategy(
    market_filter=streaming_market_filter(
        event_type_ids=["7"], market_types=["WIN"]
    ),
    sports_data_filter=["raceSubscription"],
)
```

## Strategy

Any sports data stream updates will be available in the strategy via the `process_sports_data` function

```python
class ExampleStrategy(BaseStrategy):
    def process_sports_data(
        self, market: Market, sports_data: Union[Race, CricketMatch]
    ) -> None:
        # called on each update from sports-data-stream
        print(market, sports_data)
```


## Data Recorder

The example `marketrecorder.py` can be modified to record race and cricket data by updating the `process_raw_data` with the matching `op` and data keys.

- marketSubscription `mcm` and `mc`
- orderSubscription `ocm` and `oc`
- cricketSubscription `ccm` and `cc`
- raceSubscription `rcm` and `rc`

And using the correct stream class
